ClippingBezier
===========

This library adds categories to UIBezierPath to simplify clipping a single closed UIBezierPath with another
closed or unclosed UIBezierPath.

## ClippingBezier in Loose Leaf

The ClippingBezier.framework powers the scissors tool in [Loose Leaf](http://getlooseleaf.com), and it allows
for drawing to be clipped to any imported image scraps.

## Building the framework

This library will generate a proper static framework bundle that can be used in any iOS7+ project.

## Including in your project

1. Link against the built framework and the included PerformanceBezier framework
2. Add "-ObjC++ -lstdc++" to the Other Linker Flags in the project's Settings
3. #import <PerformanceBezier/PerformanceBezier.h>
4. #import <ClippingBezier/ClippingBezier.h>

## Dependencies

This library depends on the UIBezierPath performance improvements in the [PerformanceBezier](https://github.com/adamwulf/PerformanceBezier) library.

## Example

```
UIBezierPath* aClosedPath = /* some path */;
UIBezierPath* scissorPath = /* some other path */;

NSArray* subshapes = [aClosedPath uniqueShapesCreatedFromSlicingWithUnclosedPath:scissorPath];
for(DKUIBezierPathShape* shape in subshapes){
    UIBezierPath* aClosedPathSlice = shape.fullPath;
}
```

## Screenshots

Or find the component shapes generated from two path's intersections

## Sample Application
The Xcode workspace includes a ClippingExampleApp project that shows a fully functional integration of the ClippingBezier framework. You can refer to this example for any questions about how to integrate into your app.
